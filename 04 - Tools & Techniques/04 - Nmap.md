## Description:
Nmap, short for Network Mapper, open-source tool used for network exploration, management, and security auditing. It is designed to help system administrators and security professionals discover hosts and services on a computer network, as well as create a map of the network topology.

## Information
Stealth (SYN) scansÂ 
		- Sends the initial SYN packets and waits for the SYN/ACK packet from the server
		- Does not respond to the SYN/ACK packet with ACK; thus does not complete the three way handshake
		- Called "stealth" scans because this method used to evade detection from primitive firewalls; however, this is definitely not the case with modern firewalls
			- you will be detected doing this, so the term "stealth" can be misleading
	UDP scans 
		- Are often unreliable as firewalls and routers may drop ICMP packets
		- *** But it is a mistake to neglect them 
			- TCP is only half of the equation 

## Commands

#### Set the IP address as a variable

```shell
export IP=192.168.1.100 
```

```shell
export NETW=192.168.1.0/24
```

#### Initial ScanÂ 

```shell
mkdir nmap
```

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initialÂ $IP
```

-sC Default ScriptsÂ 
-sV Enumerate VersionsÂ 
-oA Output All FormatsÂ 

#### Long/Background ScanÂ 
```shell
nmap -p- -T5 -oA nmap/allportsÂ $IP
```

-p- All Ports: 1-65535Â 
-T5 Very Aggressive Fast Scan (not recommended)Â 
-oA Output All FormatsÂ 

#### UDP scanÂ 
	Quick UDPÂ 
```shell
nmap -sU -v -oA nmap/quickudp $IP
```
	Longer UDPÂ 
```shell
nmap -v -sC -sV -sU -Pn --disable-arp-ping $IP -oA nmap/longudp
```
Â 
#### Get the ports in the right format for a targeted nmap scanÂ 

```shell
a=`grep -oP '\d{1,5}/open' kioptrix2.short.gnmap |sort -u |sed -e 's/\/open//g' |tr '\n' ','`; a=${a::-1}
```

-o Print only the matching part (not the entire line)Â 
-P interpret as Perl-compatible regexÂ  
'\d{1,5}/open' Our regex to grep for (1 to 5 occurrences of any digit followed by /open)Â 

#### Scanning ipv6Â 

```shell
nmap -sC -sV -oA scans/mischief-ipv6 -6 dead:beef::250:56ff:feb2:0190Â 
```

#### Perform a targeted port scanÂ 

```shell
nmap -p $a -sC -sV -oAÂ  /path/file_to_output_to --script vuln $IP
```

#### Webserver enumerationÂ 

```shell
nmap -p 80,443,8000,8080,8443 --script=http-enum $IP
```

#### Nmap Ping SweepÂ 

```shell
nmap -sn 10.11.0.0/16 -oG ping_sweep.txt
grep Up ping_sweep.txt |cut -f2 -d " "Â 
```
ORÂ 
```shell
nmap -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG ping_sweep.txt
grep Up ping_sweep.txt |cut -f2 -d " "
```
- Keep in mind that systems that have ICMP disabled will not respond to ping sweeps even though they are in fact online
- This method is good/effecient but not definitive

#### Find Low-Hanging FruitÂ 

```shell
nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 $IP -oG top_port_sweep.txtÂ 
grep openÂ  top_port_sweep.txt |cut -f2 -d " "Â 
```
- Machines that prove to be rich in services, or otherwise interesting, would then be individually port scanned, using a more exhaustive port list

#### OS FingerprintingÂ 

```shell
nmap -O $IP
```

- Will attempt to guess the underlying operating system, by inspecting the packets received from the target

#### kerberos (TCP 88) + LDAP (TCP 389) = Active Directory Domain Controller

#### Identifying NMAP ScriptsÂ 

```shell
locate -r '\.nse$' | xargs grep categories |grep 'default\|version' |grep smbÂ 
```
	Identify all nmap default scripts (-sC)Â 
```shell
grep -r categories /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse |grep default |awk -F: '{print $1}' |awk -F/ '{print $6}'
```

#### Check for Shellshock vulnerabilityÂ 

```shell
nmap -p 80 --script=http-shellshock --script-args uri=/cgi-bin/test.cgi --script-args uri=/cgi-bin/admin.cgi 10.11.1.71Â 
```
- For the --script-args uri use the cgi URIs that you found using ka
example
gobuster -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CGIs.txt -uÂ [http://10.11.1.71:80/](http://10.11.1.71/)Â -s '200,204,301,307,403,500' -e | tee 'alpha/10.11.1.71/scans/10.11.1.71_80_gobuster_cgi

#### View the arguments of an nmap scriptÂ 

```shell
nmap --script-help <nmap script name>Â 

```

Exmaple;
	nmap --script-help "irc-unrealircd-backdoor"

#### Enumerate NetBios UsersÂ 

```shell
nmap -sC --script=smb-enum-users $IP
```
