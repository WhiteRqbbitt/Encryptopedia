# [[04 - GoBuster]] 
---

GoBuster is a directory/file and DNS enumeration tool written in Go, used in penetration testing and CTF (Capture the Flag) scenarios to find hidden directories or files in a web server. It does this by brute-forcing GET and HEAD requests to the server. 

---
## Installation

```
$ sudo apt-get install gobuster
```
Or directly from the source:
```
$ go get github.com/OJ/gobuster
```

---
## Basic Usage

GoBuster has multiple modes: dir, dns and vhost. 

### Dir Mode
The most common use is 'dir' mode, which is used to brute-force directories and files in websites.

```
$ gobuster dir -u http://target -w /path/to/wordlist
```
In this command:
- `dir`: Indicates the mode to be used.
- `-u`: Indicates the URL for the target.
- `-w`: Indicates the wordlist to be used for brute forcing.

### DNS Mode
DNS mode is used for DNS subdomain brute-forcing.

```
$ gobuster dns -d target.com -w /path/to/wordlist
```
In this command:
- `dns`: Indicates the mode to be used.
- `-d`: Specifies the domain for DNS brute-forcing.

### Vhost Mode
Vhost mode is used to enumerate virtual hosts on the target web server.

```
$ gobuster vhost -u http://target -w /path/to/wordlist
```

---
## Common Options

- `-t`: Number of threads (default 10).
- `-x`: File extension(s) to search for.
- `-s`: Status code(s) to consider as valid (default 200,204,301,302,307,401,403).
- `-k`: Skip SSL certificate verification.
- `-n`: Don't print banner and other non-essential output.
- `-q`: Don't print the progress.
- `-o`: Write output to file.
- `-r`: Follow redirects.

---
## Examples 

```
$ gobuster dir -u http://target -w /path/to/wordlist -x php,txt -t 50
```
This will brute force directories and files with extensions `.php` and `.txt` on `http://target` using 50 threads.

```
$ gobuster dns -d target.com -w /path/to/wordlist -t 100
```
This will brute force DNS subdomains of `target.com` using 100 threads.

---
## Warning 

Ensure to use GoBuster responsibly. It's a powerful tool that can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) if misused. Always get proper permissions before conducting any penetration testing activities.

These are the basic notes for GoBuster. Depending on how advanced you want to get, you may need to dive deeper into the documentation and usage examples.
