## Evolution of the Term "Computer"
1. **Historical Meaning**: Originally referred to a human who performed computations by hand, similar to an accountant. E.g., "We need to hire a computer."
2. **1940s/1950s**: The term shifted to reference large machines.
3. **1970s/1980s**: The term expanded to refer to:
    - Personal Computers (PCs): Smaller home/office computers. "Personal" because they weren't shared among multiple users like the large machines.
    - Portable/laptop computers.
4. **2000s/2010s**:
    - The term now encompasses other computing devices such as pads, book readers, smartphones, etc.
    - Refers to computing devices embedded in other electronics: e.g., medical equipment, automobiles, consumer electronics, military systems.

## Distinction between Hardware and Software
- **Hardware**: The physical equipment, initially prone to failures.
- **Software**: As equipment became more stable and programs larger, this term was coined to distinguish a computer's programs from its hardware.

## Key Components of a Computer

### 1. Input/Output Devices (Peripherals)
   - **Monitor**: Displays items, can be textual or graphical.
   - **Keyboard**: Allows user input, often accompanied by a mouse for graphical displays.
   - **Touchscreens**: Replacing keyboards and mice in many modern devices.
   - **Others**: Microphones, speakers, printers, USB interfaces.

### 2. Storage
   - **Disk (Hard Drive)**: Non-volatile, stores files/data.
      - Maintains contents even when powered off.
      - Works by orienting magnetic particles in 0 or 1 positions.
   - **Flash Storage Devices**: Uses non-volatile memory, storing 0s and 1s using electricity.

### 3. Memory (RAM - Random-Access Memory)
   - Temporarily holds data read from storage.
   - Much faster access than disk.
   - **Volatile**: Loses its contents when powered off.
   - **Sizes**:
      - Byte: 8 bits.
      - Megabytes: Million bytes.
      - Gigabytes: Billion bytes.
      - Terabytes: Trillion bytes.

### 4. Processor (CPU or Microprocessor)
   - Runs computer programs.
   - Reads/executes instructions from memory.
   - Executes the BIOS upon startup, setting up basic peripherals and then executes the Operating System.
   - **Cache Memory**: Small amount of RAM on the processor for the most-used instructions/data.

### 5. Clock
   - Governs the rate of processor's instructions execution.
   - Frequencies range from:
      - 1 MHz (1 million ticks/second) for cheaper processors.
      - 1 GHz (1 billion ticks/second) for more advanced processors.
   - Executes millions or billions of instructions per second.

## Multitasking
- Computers typically run multiple programs simultaneously.
- The **Operating System (OS)** manages these multiple simultaneous programs.

## Transition from Computers to ICs
1. **Initial Computers**: Large devices that occupied entire rooms.
2. **Invention of Transistors**: Smaller switches that replaced bulky vacuum tubes used in earlier computers.
3. **Integrated Circuit (IC)** (1958): Transistors were integrated onto a single chip.

## Moore's Law
- **Statement**: Doubling of IC capacity roughly every 18 months for several decades.
- **Clarification**:
    - Moore originally stated the doubling occurred every 2 years.
    - The trend varied, sometimes occurring in 18 months.
    - Key takeaway: Significant improvement over time.
    - **Source**: Intel's documentation on Moore's Law.

## The Rise of Microprocessors
1. **First Microprocessor**: In 1971, Intel introduced the 4004.
    - Called a "microprocessor" (with "micro-" indicating its small size).
    - Contained 2,300 transistors.
2. **Progression**: More powerful microprocessors developed every few years.
3. **2012 Benchmark**:
    - Single ICs housed several billion transistors.
    - Contained multiple processors, each termed a "core."

**Key Points to Remember**:

1. The term 'computer' has evolved over time, from humans doing manual computations to advanced electronic devices.
2. Distinct separation between hardware (physical machine) and software (programs).
3. Computers consist of I/O devices, storage, memory, a processor, and a clock.
4. The OS allows and manages multitasking.
5. Transition from room-sized computers to the invention of transistors and integrated circuits.
6. The significance and implications of Moore's Law.
7. Evolution of microprocessors, from the first 4004 by Intel to multi-core processors with billions of transistors by 2012.
