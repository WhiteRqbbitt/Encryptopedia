# [[03 - PowerShell - Analyzing Obfuscated Scripts]]  
___

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell developed by Microsoft. It's deeply integrated with the Windows operating system and is commonly used for system administration tasks. However, it's also frequently exploited by malicious actors who use it to perform actions on compromised systems or to deliver malware.

Obfuscation is a common technique used in malicious PowerShell scripts to avoid detection by security tools and make analysis more difficult.

## Understanding Obfuscation

Obfuscation in PowerShell scripts can take many forms, including:

- **String Concatenation**: Breaking up strings and recombining them at runtime to avoid detection of malicious keywords or signatures.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Encoding scripts in Base64 and then decoding them at runtime.
- **Variable Substitution**: Using variable substitution to hide the actual commands being executed.
- **Function Abstraction**: Abstracting functionality into functions to make the code less readable.

## De-Obfuscation Techniques

De-obfuscation is the process of reversing the obfuscation to make the script readable and understandable. Here are some techniques:

- **Manual Analysis**: This involves reading and understanding the code to manually decode the obfuscation techniques used. This can be time-consuming and requires a good understanding of PowerShell scripting.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the script in a controlled environment to observe its behavior. This can include use of PowerShell's `-Verbose` flag, tracing (`Set-PSDebug -Trace 1`), or transcript (`Start-Transcript`) functionality.
- **Automated Tools**: Tools like `PSDecode`, `Invoke-Obfuscation`, `Revoke-Obfuscation`, and `PowerShell AST` (Abstract Syntax Tree) can help in identifying and reversing obfuscation techniques.

## Common Indicators of Obfuscation

While obfuscation techniques can vary greatly, some common indicators in PowerShell scripts include:

- Excessive use of backticks (above tab) , which are used for escape sequencing in PowerShell.
- Unusually long one-liner scripts.
- High ratio of special characters.
- Base64-encoded strings.
- Usage of `-encodedcommand` switch, which allows input of Base64-encoded commands.
- Multiple layers of script invocations (for example, PowerShell within PowerShell).

## Security Considerations

- Always analyze scripts in a controlled environment to avoid inadvertent execution of malicious code.
- Keep in mind that highly obfuscated scripts are often (but not always) an indicator of malicious intent.
- Understanding the basics of PowerShell scripting will greatly aid in analysis and de-obfuscation efforts.
