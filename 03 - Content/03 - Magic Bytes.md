## What are Magic Bytes?

Magic bytes, also known as magic numbers, are specific numerical or string values used at the start of a file that can help to identify or verify the format of a file. 

## Why are Magic Bytes Important?

1. **File Type Identification**: Magic bytes allow software to quickly identify the type of a file without relying on the extension, which can be easily changed. For example, a .jpg file always starts with the bytes `FF D8 FF`.

2. **Data Validation**: Magic bytes can also serve as a rudimentary form of data validation. If a file doesn't start with the expected magic bytes, software can immediately know that the file is not of the expected format or that it may be corrupted.

## How are Magic Bytes Used?

1. **File Analysis**: Tools like `file` in Unix or Linux can read the magic bytes of a file to identify its type. This can be useful in forensics and data recovery, as well as in malware analysis to identify the type of a payload.

2. **Programming**: In programming, magic numbers are often used to mark or tag data. For example, a developer might use a specific magic number to mark the start of a session or a specific transaction.

3. **Malware Analysis**: In malware analysis, magic bytes can be used to identify the type of a file or a payload. For example, if a payload starts with the magic bytes of a .exe file, the analyst would know that the payload is an executable.

## Examples of Magic Bytes

Commonly used magic bytes and their associated file types:
