# PowerShell Cmdlets

PowerShell introduces the concept of "cmdlets" (pronounced "command-lets"). These are lightweight commands built into the PowerShell environment. Each cmdlet is designed to perform a single function, and they follow the verb-noun naming convention, making them easy to understand.

For example:
- `Get-ChildItem` - retrieves the items (files and directories) in a directory.
- `Set-Location` - changes the current directory.
- `New-Item` - creates a new item (like a file or directory).

Cmdlets return data as .NET objects, allowing for rich data manipulation and formatting.

## PowerShell ISE

The PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is a graphical interface that assists with creating, testing, and running PowerShell scripts. Key features include:

1. **Script Pane**: A dedicated area to write and edit scripts.
2. **Command Pane**: Execute individual commands or run the script you've written.
3. **Output Pane**: View results/output of executed commands or scripts.
4. **Command Search/Add-on Tools**: Easily search for cmdlets or use built-in tools to enhance your scripting experience.

To open PowerShell ISE:
1. Go to the Start menu.
2. Type "powershell".
3. Select the "Windows PowerShell ISE" application.

PowerShell ISE is invaluable when writing long scripts, as it provides debugging capabilities, syntax highlighting, and tab completion.
