**NIST Incident Response Framework: Preparation and Prevention**

## **Incident Preparation:**

1. **Communication:** Establish secure, readily available contact information and communication methods. Utilize secure incident reporting mechanisms and a war room for communication base.
2. **Hardware and Software:** Pre-install hardware and software for incident analysis. Includes forensic workstations, backup drives, disk images, laptops for live analysis, packet sniffers, and spare hardware for compromised devices.
3. **Evidence Handling:** Maintain both used and blank removable storage media for backup and evidence storage. Accessories for evidence gathering should be readily available.
4. **Analysis Resources:** Prepare port lists, documentation for systems, applications, protocols, and IDS, network diagrams, and lists of critical assets. Maintain baseline activity and hashes of critical files for comparison and assessment.
5. **Mitigation Software:** Keep access to clean images of operating systems and applications for easy restoration.

## **Incident Prevention:**

1. **Risk Assessments:** Perform regular risk assessments with a risk matrix to visualize and prioritize risks. The overall level of risk is determined by the threat level, vulnerability level, and information value.
2. **Host Security:** Enable auditing and log all security events, and approach host security with the principle of least privilege. 
3. **Network Security:** Deny all network activity that isn't expressly permitted, like VPNs and connections to external organizations.
4. **Malware Prevention:** Deploy AV software across all hosts, servers, and clients, and configure a network-level firewall to block connections from/to known malicious domains and IP addresses.
5. **User Awareness Training:** Educate all users about security policies, procedures, and acceptable use of networks, systems, and applications. IT staff should maintain security standards across all platforms. Share lessons learned from incidents with all users.
