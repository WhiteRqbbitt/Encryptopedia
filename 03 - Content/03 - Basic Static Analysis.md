##  Strings & FLOSS: Static String Analysis

Floss is a FlareVM tool made by FireEye that will pull out any strings over 4 characters.
	This can sometimes show us interesting and telling information

Tip: FLOSS can be run with the "-n" argument to specify your desired minimum string length. Sometimes, longer strings can be more useful to an analyst than your standard string of len(4).

For example, if I want to pull all strings of length 6 or greater, I can issue the following command:

floss.exe -n 6 `malware_name.exe`
