## Hashing Malware Samples

Using Cmder on FlareVM we can get the Hash values for the "suspected" malware or known sample.

##  Strings & FLOSS: Static String Analysis

Floss is a FlareVM tool made by FireEye that will pull out any strings over 4 characters.
	This can sometimes show us interesting and telling information

Tip: FLOSS can be run with the "-n" argument to specify your desired minimum string length. Sometimes, longer strings can be more useful to an analyst than your standard string of len(4).

For example, if I want to pull all strings of length 6 or greater, I can issue the following command:

floss.exe -n 6 `malware_name.exe`

## Analyzing the Import Address Table

PEview provides a quick and easy way to view the structure and content of 32-bit Portable Executable (PE) and Component Object File Format (COFF) files. This PE/COFF file viewer displays header, section, directory, import table, export table, and resource information within EXE, DLL, OBJ, LIB, DBG, and other file types.

### After Opening a Sample

#### Image NT Headers
	Image File Header - this can give us a `time date stamp` for when the sample was compiled, though this is not always reliable.

#### Image Section Header
	We can compare the `Virtual Size` and the `Size of Raw Data` fields to identity if the size is the same or perhaps the Virtual Size is larger and we are dealing with a packed binary.

#### IMPORT Address Table
	This section is important for getting clues on the type of Windows API calls being made.

## malapi.io 
	A Mitre Attack Framework type website that has various Windows API calls and if they are particularly interesting as far as malware is concerned.
