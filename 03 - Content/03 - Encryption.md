# Overview

Encryption is the technique of converting data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. The main purpose is to ensure the confidentiality of data, ensuring that only intended recipients can interpret the information.
## Key Capabilities

1. **Authentication:** Verifies the origin of the message for the recipient.
2. **Integrity:** Provides proof that the content of the message hasn't been altered post-transmission.
3. **Non-repudiation:** Ensures that the sender can't deny sending the message.
## Essential Components for Encryption

To encrypt data:
1. **Unencrypted Data:** The original data you aim to encrypt.
2. **Encryption Key:** A special key that will be employed for encryption.
3. **Encryption Algorithm:** A mathematical function that uses the unencrypted data and the key to produce encrypted data.

For decryption, the requirements are similar:
1. **Encrypted Data:** The scrambled data.
2. **Decryption Key:** A key to revert the encrypted data to its original form.
3. **Encryption Algorithm:** The specific mathematical function used in the encryption process.
## Strong Encryption

Good encryption algorithms are public, transparent, and have endured and passed scrutiny from top mathematicians. Depending solely on algorithm secrecy is a sign of weak encryption. Time-tested algorithms with no discovered flaws are the most trustworthy.

**Recommendation:** Avoid older encryption methods like DES, which can be deciphered using modern computing power due to its limited key size.
## Breaking Encryption

There are two primary approaches to breaching encryption:
1. **Flaw Exploitation:** Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithm. It's uncommon for mature algorithms to have unaddressed flaws.
2. **Key Guessing:** Attempting to determine the encryption key. This approach is effective only with outdated algorithms like DES, which have a small encryption key size. For instance, DES, from the 1970s, had a maximum key size of 56 bits, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks on modern computers.
