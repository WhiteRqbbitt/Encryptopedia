## Initial Access
* Initial access is the first phase where the attacker attempts to gain entry to the target network or system.

|Common Initial Access Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Phishing|Attackers send fraudulent emails to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or installing malware.|
|Drive-by Compromise|Exploiting vulnerabilities in a web browser to execute a malicious script.|

## Execution
* This phase involves the attacker executing a malicious payload on a compromised system.

|Common Execution Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Scripting|Attackers use scripts (like PowerShell) to automate their tasks and avoid detection.|
|User Execution|Tricking users into running a malicious program.|

## Persistence
* Attackers establish a persistent presence in the victim's network to survive reboot and other interruptions.

|Common Persistence Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Registry Modification|Changes to the registry to start the malware during system boot.|
|Scheduled Task/Job|Scheduling tasks or jobs that execute the malicious program at regular intervals.|

## Privilege Escalation
* Attackers seek to gain higher-level permissions on the system.

|Common Privilege Escalation Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Bypassing User Account Control|Tricking the Windows User Account Control (UAC) to grant admin privileges.|
|Exploitation for Privilege Escalation|Exploiting a software vulnerability to gain elevated access.|

## Defense Evasion
* Techniques used to avoid detection.

|Common Defense Evasion Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information|Attackers often obfuscate their code to evade detection.|
|Disabling Security Tools|Disabling firewalls, antivirus, or other security tools on the system.|

## Credential Access
* Attackers steal account names and passwords.

|Common Credential Access Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Input Capture|Using keyloggers or similar tools to capture user inputs.|
|Credential Dumping|Attacker obtains user credentials by reading system memory.|

## Discovery
* Attackers gather information about the system and internal network.

|Common Discovery Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|System Network Configuration Discovery|Learning about the network configuration.|
|System Information Discovery|Collecting system details like OS, hostname, etc.|

## Lateral Movement
* Moving through a network, accessing other systems.

|Common Lateral Movement Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)|Using RDP to move between systems in a network.|
|SSH Hijacking|Hijacking an existing SSH session to gain control.|

## Collection
* Gathering valuable data.

|Common Collection Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Data Staged|Collecting data in a central location before exfiltration.|
|Data from Information Repositories|Extracting data from databases or other repositories.|

## Command and Control
* Attacker controls compromised systems via a network connection.

|Common Command and Control Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Commonly Used Port|Using commonly used network ports to hide malicious traffic.|
|Web Service|Using a web service for C2, often to blend in with normal traffic.|

## Exfiltration
* Extracting the valuable data out of the network.

|Common Exfiltration Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Data Compressed|Compressing data to facilitate transfer.|
|Scheduled Transfer|Setting up automated data transfer out of the network.| 

## Impact
* The objective of the attack, typically resulting in disruption to systems and data.

|Common Impact Techniques| Description|
|----|----|
|Data Destruction|Destroying or deleting data from the victim's system.|
|Inhibit System Recovery|Disabling system recovery features or backup systems to make remediation more difficult.|
|Denial of Service|Flooding a network or system with traffic or requests to render it inaccessible to its intended users.|
