## What are Hidden Files? 
Hidden files in Windows are files with the 'hidden' attribute added. When a file has this attribute, it will not be visible when viewing folders in the regular mode. Even though they are hidden, these files continue to exist and can be edited or used as usual.

## How to Hide a File or Folder?
To set a file or folder as hidden:
1. Right-click on the file or folder you wish to hide.
2. Select 'Properties'.
3. In the properties window, look for the section called 'Attributes'.
4. Check the box labeled 'Hidden' and click 'OK'.

*Visual Reference:* The properties window of a file has a section named Attributes with checkboxes for "read-only" and "hidden". To hide a file, the 'hidden' checkbox should be ticked.

==Remember:== After hiding a file or folder, unless you've configured Windows Explorer to show hidden files, you won't be able to see it.

## How to View Hidden Files? 
To view files and folders that have been set as hidden:
1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the ribbon at the top and select the 'View' tab.
3. Open 'Folder Options' or its equivalent, often found as a button or dropdown.
4. Under the 'View' tab in 'Folder Options', locate the 'Hidden files and folders' section.
5. Choose the option 'Show hidden files, folders, and drives'.

*Visual Reference:* In the folder options window, there's an option for "Hidden files and folders" with two choices:
1. Don't show hidden files, folders, or drives
2. Show hidden files, folders, and drives

For viewing hidden items, the second option must be selected.

## Appearance of Hidden Files
When hidden files are made visible in Windows Explorer, they will have a translucent icon to differentiate them from regular files. This serves as a visual cue that these files are hidden.

*Visual Example:* In a folder with multiple text files, a file named "file4.txt" is shown with a translucent icon, indicating that it is a hidden file.

==Key Point:== Hidden files, when made visible, are distinguished by a translucent icon.
