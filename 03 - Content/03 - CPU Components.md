# [[03 - CPU Components]]

# Overview
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the primary component responsible for executing computer programs. Its core components include the Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, and Registers.
## Control Unit (CU)
- **Definition**: The Control Unit directs the execution of program instructions by sending electrical signals to the computer system.
- **Analogy**: 
  - Think of the CU as the **director of a movie** or the **conductor of an orchestra**.
  - It doesn't execute program instructions directly but guides other parts of the computer to do so.
## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- **Function**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
### Arithmetic Operations
1. **Addition**: Adds values.
2. **Subtraction**: Deducts values.
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies values.
4. **Division**: Divides values.
### Logical Operations
- Responsible for making comparisons between values.
1. **Equal-To**: Determines if two values are identical.
2. **Less-Than**: Checks if one value is smaller than another.
3. **Greater-Than**: Compares if one value exceeds another.
4. Additional Operations:
   - **NOT**: Negates a comparison, e.g., NOT Equal To (two values are different).
   - **OR**: Checks for multiple conditions, e.g., Less Than OR Equal To.

> Note: More detailed exploration of logical operations will be covered in the data modules.
## Registers
- **Definition**: Small memory units physically inside the CPU.
- **Features**:
  - **Faster than RAM**: Due to their location inside the CPU, electrical signals have minimal distance to travel.
  - **Limited Capacity**: There are few registers, and they can hold a very restricted amount of data.
  - Explored in detail in the section on CPU registers.
## Register Capacity based on Architecture
- **32-bit architecture**: 
  - Register capacity: 32 bits of data
  - Equivalent to: 4 bytes or 4 characters (using ASCII encoding)
- **64-bit architecture**: 
  - Register capacity: 64 bits of data
  - Equivalent to: 8 bytes or 8 characters (using ASCII encoding)
## General Purpose Registers

### For 32-bit Intel CPU (x86)
Four primary registers that can be divided into sub-registers:
1. **EAX**: 
   - Divided into AX, AL (lower 8 bits of AX), and AH (higher 8 bits of AX)
2. **EBX**: 
   - Similar to EAX, it can be split as BX, BL, BH
3. **ECX**
4. **EDX**

|_8 bits_|_8 bits_|_8 bits_|_8 bits_|
|---|---|---|---|
|EAX|EAX|EAX|EAX|
|||AX|AX|
|||AH|AL|

> Note: Accessing different sections of a register (like AH or AL) doesn't change the overall register. You're just viewing specific portions of it.
### Other General Purpose Registers
These are less divisible than the primary ones:
1. **ESP (Stack Pointer)**: Points to the top of the current stack frame in RAM.
2. **EBP (Base Pointer)**: Points to the bottom of the current stack frame in RAM.
3. **ESI (Source Index)**: Holds the memory address of source data in operations.
4. **EDI (Destination Index)**: Contains the destination memory address for operations.

> Caution: While named 'general purpose', some registers serve specific functions. Indiscriminate data storage in them can lead to issues.
## Special Purpose Registers
Registers reserved for specific tasks and can't be freely manipulated by most programs.
- **EIP (Instruction Pointer)**: 
  - Specific to 32-bit Intel x86 processors.
  - Holds the memory address of the next CPU instruction.

> Note: There are more special purpose registers, but they are omitted here for simplicity.
## Key Takeaways
1. **General Purpose Registers**:
   - Primary registers on 32-bit CPUs are divisible, and each segment refers to a specific portion.
   - There are registers with specific functions like stack pointers and index holders.
2. **Special Purpose Registers**: Reserved for crucial tasks, the most prominent being the instruction pointer.

# Fetch - Decode - Execute

## Introduction
The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle is the fundamental process a CPU follows to carry out program instructions. This sequence ensures that a CPU functions systematically, carrying out instructions step-by-step from the RAM to execution.
## Breakdown

### 1. **Fetch**
The Control Unit (CU) of the CPU initiates the cycle by:
- Fetching the next instruction from RAM.
- This is essentially "retrieving" or "picking up" the next command to be executed.
### 2. **Decode**
Once fetched, the instruction isn't immediately actionable. Therefore:
- The Control Unit decodes or translates the fetched instruction into a form the CPU can understand.
- If necessary, the CU retrieves relevant data from the memory and sends it to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
### 3. **Execute**
After decoding, the instruction is ready for action:
- The ALU takes charge, executing the decoded instruction using the data provided.
- Depending on the instruction, the ALU performs arithmetic or logical operations.
### 4. **Store**
Post execution, the result is stored:
- The ALU then saves the result of its computation.
- This result is stored either back in a specific memory register within the CPU or in RAM.
## Cycle Continuation
- After the completion of these steps, the process restarts.
- The cycle will continue, fetching the next instruction and repeating the process as long as the program is running.
## Quick Recap
1. **Fetch**: CU retrieves instruction from RAM.
2. **Decode**: CU decodes the instruction and sends relevant data to ALU.
3. **Execute**: ALU performs the required action.
4. **Store**: The result of the action is stored in memory.

# RAM: Stack and Heap

## Introduction
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a form of volatile memory that provides fast access to stored data. It's separated into different sections for different purposes: the Stack and the Heap.
## The Stack

### 1. **Structure and Order**
- The stack is an organized, Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) section of memory.
- Every time a function is called, it's allocated a stack frame.
### 2. **Stack Frame**
- Contains local variables and control data for functions.
- For instance, if a function prompts user input, the input would be stored in the stack frame.
### 3. **Return Pointer**
- It's the memory address the CPU should jump back to after the function has finished executing.
- When a function is called, the CPU saves the address of the next instruction on the stack. This address is then used to return to the original flow of execution after the function completes.
## The Heap
### 1. **Lack of Structure**
- The heap is more free-form and lacks the orderly structure of the stack.
### 2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- Allows for memory to be allocated on the fly, without prior knowledge of the data's size.
- Useful for data with unpredictable size.
## Instructions vs Data
### 1. **Indistinguishable to the CPU**
- To the CPU, both instructions and data look the same (binary). The differentiation arises from how they're used.
### 2. **Execution Context**
- If the instruction pointer points to a location, the CPU treats that location's content as instructions.
### 3. **Data Context**
- If a memory operation is performed on a location, the content is treated as data.
### 4. **Potential for Exploitation**
- Misleading the CPU to treat data as instructions (or vice versa) can lead to unintended behaviors or system vulnerabilities. This concept is a cornerstone of various cyber attacks, such as buffer overflows.

## Key Takeaways

- **Stack**: Structured, used for function calls, and contains local variables.
- **Heap**: Unstructured, used for dynamic memory allocation.
- **Instructions vs Data**: The CPU treats memory content based on the context (instruction pointer for instructions, memory operations for data). Mistaking one for the other can be exploited.
