# [[03 - CPU Components]]  

___
# Overview
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the primary component responsible for executing computer programs. Its core components include the Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, and Registers.
## Control Unit (CU)
- **Definition**: The Control Unit directs the execution of program instructions by sending electrical signals to the computer system.
- **Analogy**: 
  - Think of the CU as the **director of a movie** or the **conductor of an orchestra**.
  - It doesn't execute program instructions directly but guides other parts of the computer to do so.
## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- **Function**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
### Arithmetic Operations
1. **Addition**: Adds values.
2. **Subtraction**: Deducts values.
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies values.
4. **Division**: Divides values.
### Logical Operations
- Responsible for making comparisons between values.
1. **Equal-To**: Determines if two values are identical.
2. **Less-Than**: Checks if one value is smaller than another.
3. **Greater-Than**: Compares if one value exceeds another.
4. Additional Operations:
   - **NOT**: Negates a comparison, e.g., NOT Equal To (two values are different).
   - **OR**: Checks for multiple conditions, e.g., Less Than OR Equal To.

> Note: More detailed exploration of logical operations will be covered in the data modules.
## Registers
- **Definition**: Small memory units physically inside the CPU.
- **Features**:
  - **Faster than RAM**: Due to their location inside the CPU, electrical signals have minimal distance to travel.
  - **Limited Capacity**: There are few registers, and they can hold a very restricted amount of data.
  - Explored in detail in the section on CPU registers.
## Key Takeaways
1. **Control Unit (CU)**: Directs and manages the flow of operations within the CPU.
2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Executes mathematical and logical computations.
3. **Registers**: On-CPU memory units that provide quick data access, but with extremely limited capacity.
