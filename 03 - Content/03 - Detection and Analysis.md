**NIST Incident Response Framework: Detection and Analysis**

## **Attack Vectors:**

1. Awareness of potential attack vectors is critical. Examples include attrition, email-based attacks, external/removable media, impersonation, improper use, and theft of equipment.

## **Signs of an Incident:**

1. Signs fall into two categories: Precursors (future incidents) and Indicators (current or past incidents).
2. Examples of precursors: vulnerability scans, new exploits, threats from malicious groups.
3. Examples of indicators: IDS alerts, antivirus detections, unusual filenames, suspicious emails, unusual network activity.

## **Sources of Precursors and Indicators:**

1. Alert-based sources: IDSs, SIEMs, antivirus software, third-party monitoring services.
2. Log-based sources: OS, service, application logs, network device logs.
3. People-based sources: Individuals from within or outside the organization.
4. Publicly available information: Intelligence on new vulnerabilities and exploits.

## **Analysis:**

1. Alerts must be analyzed for accuracy and validity, distinguishing true-positives from false-positives and accounting for false-negatives.
2. Complex incidents require collaborative analysis to identify scope, origin, and methods used.
3. Recommended practices: Profiling networks/systems, understanding normal behaviors, log retention policy, event correlation, time synchronization, maintaining a knowledge base, internet research, running packet sniffers, data filtering, and seeking assistance.

## **Documentation:**

1. Track incident status, summary, related indicators and incidents, handler actions, chain of custody, impact assessments, contact information, gathered evidence, handler comments, and next steps.

## **Prioritization:**

1. Factors: functional impact (operational effect), information impact (reputation), and recoverability (response effectiveness).

## **Escalation:**

1. Establish process for situations where the team cannot respond to an incident in the designated time due to various reasons.

## **Notification:**

1. After analysis and prioritization, notify all appropriate personnel (CIO, information security head, system owners, HR, public affairs).
2. Prepared communication methods should be in place to provide status updates.
