### Hashes

SHA256
```

```



___
### Challenge Questions:

### Basic Static Analysis
---

- What is the SHA256 hash of the sample?
- What architecture is this binary?
- Are there any results from submitting the SHA256 hash to VirusTotal?
- Describe the results of pulling the strings from this binary. Record and describe any strings that are potentially interesting. Can any interesting information be extracted from the strings?
- Describe the results of inspecting the IAT for this binary. Are there any imports worth noting?
- Is it likely that this binary is packed?
---

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
 - Describe initial detonation. Are there any notable occurrences at first detonation? Without internet simulation? With internet simulation?
 - From the host-based indicators perspective, what is the main payload that is initiated at detonation? What tool can you use to identify this?
 - What is the DNS record that is queried at detonation?
 - What is the callback port number at detonation?
 - What is the callback protocol at detonation?
 - How can you use host-based telemetry to identify the DNS record, port, and protocol?
 - Attempt to get the binary to initiate a shell on the localhost. Does a shell spawn? What is needed for a shell to spawn?
