# [[03 - Virtualization]]  

# **Definition of Virtualization**

- Virtualization allows for the creation of a virtual computer or **virtual machine (VM)** made from software that simulates the behavior of a separate computer.
- In VMs, hardware components are all software-based.
- The VM uses the hardware resources of the host computer it runs on.
- This concept is facilitated using a **hypervisor**, which acts as an intermediary layer, disrupting the direct relationship between an OS and the hardware.

**Key Point**: Virtualization lets us run one operating system inside another. E.g., Windows inside Linux.
### **Hypervisor**

- A crucial component in virtualization.
- Breaks the conventional 1:1 relationship between the OS and hardware.
- There are different types of hypervisors which will be explored later.
### **Examples of Virtualization**

- Running Windows 10 inside VMware Workstation (a virtualization software) on top of an Ubuntu Linux system.
- Conceptually: Running Windows and Mac OS X concurrently or Windows while running Linux.
### **Host Operating System**

- The main operating system that runs the virtualization software.
- Considered the "master" OS as it is the first to load when the physical computer is powered on.
### **Guest Operating System**

- The OS running within the virtual machine.
- Isolated from the host OS and doesn't have direct access to host resources.
**Example**: If Windows is the host and Linux is the guest, Linux can't directly access files on the Windows desktop.
### **Importance of Separation**

- The separation between the host and guest OS is vital for security reasons.
- E.g., When analyzing a computer virus, using a VM ensures the host OS remains unaffected and prevents the virus from escaping to the internet.

**Key Practices to Remember**:
1. Always be aware of which OS is your host and which one is the guest.
2. For tasks with security implications (like malware analysis), always use a VM to maintain a safe environment.
