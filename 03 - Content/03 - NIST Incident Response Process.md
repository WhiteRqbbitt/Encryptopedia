# [[03 - NIST Incident Response Process]]  
___
1. Preparation
2. Detection and analysis
3. Containment, eradication, and recovery
4. Post-incident activity


## 1. [[03 - Preparation|Preparation]]
- Develop and implement an Incident Response Policy and Plan.
- Set up an Incident Response Team (IRT), typically consisting of a coordinator/manager and technical experts.
- Provide regular training and exercises to the IRT to keep their skills sharp.
- Implement tools and resources that aid in detecting, analyzing, and mitigating incidents.
- Establish communication methods and procedures for both within the IRT and with external entities.

## 2. [[03 - Detection and Analysis|Detection and Analysis]]
- Monitor system events to detect potential security incidents.
- Analyze anomalies in system behavior or data patterns to identify possible security incidents.
- Analyze the threat landscape regularly to understand emerging threats and trends.
- Prioritize incidents based on factors like potential impact, criticality of affected systems, and requirements of related SLAs or laws.
- Document incidents properly: symptoms, affected systems, potential impact, applied response measures, and more.

## 3. [[03 - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery|Containment, Eradication, and Recovery]]
- Decide on short-term and long-term containment strategies based on the type and severity of the incident.
- Eradicate the root cause of the incident: remove malware, reimage systems, change passwords, etc.
- Recover systems and services: restore them to normal operation and confirm they're no longer affected.
- Implement lessons learned during the incident to improve prevention and detection capabilities.

## 4. [[03 - Post-Incident Activity|Post-Incident Activity]]
- Conduct a post-incident review to understand what happened, how it was handled, and what can be done better.
- Use insights from this review to refine the Incident Response Plan and other security policies.
- Collect incident data and use it for risk assessments, awareness training, or sharing with external entities (in accordance with laws and policies).
- Preserve evidence in case of a legal action.

# Additional NIST Recommendations
- Use NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide (SP 800-61) as a resource.
- Follow a continuous improvement model: always look for ways to enhance your organization's incident response capabilities.
- Cooperate with external entities (law enforcement, ISACs, vendors, etc.) when necessary and beneficial.
- Consider cyber insurance as a risk management tool.
