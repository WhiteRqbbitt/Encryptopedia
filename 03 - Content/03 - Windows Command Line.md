### 1. Changing Directory (cd)
The `cd` command is used to change directories (move between folders). 

- To navigate to the root of the file system: 
    ```shell
    cd \
    ```

**Tips:**
- Use **tab completion** for directory names to ease typing.
- Command Prompt is **not case sensitive**: `CD`, `cd`, and `Cd` are all valid.

**Example:**
```
C:\Users\User\Documents>cd \
C:\>
```

---
### 2. Changing Drives
To switch between available drives on your machine:

- Input the drive letter followed by `:`. 
  ```shell
  d:
  ```

- If you know the directory on the new drive, navigate straight to it using `cd` with the `/D` switch. 
  ```shell
  cd /D C:\Windows
  ```

**Example:**
```
C:\Users\User\Documents>D:
D:\>
```
```
D:\>cd /D C:\Windows
C:\Windows>
```

---

### 3. Viewing Directory Contents
The `dir` command displays files and directories in the current directory, showing details like modification date, time, and file size.

- Basic use:
  ```shell
  dir
  ```

**Details:**
- By default, `dir` does not display hidden files and folders.
- To display hidden files/folders, use the `/A` switch.
  ```shell
  dir /A
  ```

**Example Output:**
```
C:\Users\User\Demo>dir
Volume in drive C has no label.
...
Directory of C:\Users\User\Demo
...
```
