# [[CSE-110 What is a programming language]]  

- **Natural vs. Programming Languages:**
   - **Natural Languages:** Evolved languages developed over time, e.g., Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish. These support a broad spectrum of communication needs.
   - **Programming Languages:** Constructed languages designed for specific tasks. Primarily, to provide machines with unambiguous instructions.

- **Characteristics of Programming Languages:**
   - Generally small and simple.
   - Designed to communicate precise machine instructions.

- **Examples of Programming Languages:**
   - Similar ones: C++, Java, C#
   - Different ones: Scheme, Prolog, Python

- **Programming Languages (A Few Examples from Table 1.7.1):**
   ```markdown
   | Programming Language | Programming Language | Programming Language |
   |----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
   | ActionScript         | Eiffel               | OCaml                |
   | Ada                  | Erlang               | Pascal               |
   | ALGOL                | F#                   | Perl                 |
   | ...                  | ...                  | ...                  |
   ```

- **Key Concepts in Language Studies:**
   - **Syntax:** Set of rules defining how sentences or statements are formed.
   - **Semantics:** The meaning of sentences or statements.

- **Difference between Natural and Programming Languages:**
   - **Natural Languages:**
     - Complex and open to interpretation.
     - Words/phrases can have multiple meanings.
     - Context-sensitive: Context can change meanings.
   - **Programming Languages:**
     - Simple and clear-cut.
     - Each statement has a single, clear meaning.
     - Context-free: Consistent meaning irrespective of the context.

- **Importance of Context-Free Nature in Programming:**
   - Computers require precision and cannot deduce context.
   - Unambiguous instructions ensure error-free, fast execution.

### What is Java?

- **Java's Role:**
   - A general-purpose programming language.
   - Designed for platform-independent programming.

- **Java's Key Features:**
   - **Object-Oriented:** It's class-based, primed for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
   - **Strongly Typed:** Requires type declarations for variables.
   - **Compiled & Interpreted:** Converts source code to bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM interprets bytecode, enabling cross-platform execution.

- **Applications of Java:**
   - Used in sectors like enterprise software, medical applications, gaming, and mobile devices.
   - Core to the Android Operating System.

### Takeaways:

- Programming languages aim to provide clear instructions for machines.
- Understand the distinction between syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
- Java's architecture makes it versatile and platform-independent.
- Java is pivotal in tech, especially for Android development.
