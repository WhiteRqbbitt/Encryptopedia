# [[CSE-110 Computer program basics]]  

### 1. What is a Computer Program?
- Computer programs are essential in today's digital age.
- They power various applications like smartphones, online businesses, vehicles, and more.
- A computer program consists of a sequence of instructions executed one after another.

### 2. Basic Instruction Types:

1. **Input**: A program receives data from sources such as a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
2. **Process**: A program performs calculations on the data, e.g., `x + y`.
3. **Output**: A program delivers the processed data to an output device or location like a file, screen, or network.

### 3. Variables in Programs:

- Programs use variables to represent data.
- Variables have names (e.g., `x`, `y`, `z`) and their values can change or vary during program execution.

#### Example: Basic Computer Program
```markdown
1. x = Get next input (Input from keyboard)
2. y = Get next input (Input from keyboard)
3. z = x + y (Process)
4. Put z to output (Output to screen)
```
Output:
```python
x: 2
y: 5
z: 7
```

### 4. Understanding Programming Instructions:

- The instruction `z = x + y` in programming is an assignment
- Unlike alg
- If `x = 10` and `y = 20`, then `z` will be assigned the value `30`.

### 5. Computer Programs as Recipes:

- A computer program can be thought of as a recipe.
- Just like a chef follows step-by-step instructions in a recipe, a computer follows the instructions in a program.

### 6. First Programming Activity:

- Experiment with rearranging instructions to observe how the output changes.
- For example:
  ```python
  m = 5
  put m
  m = m * 2
  put m
  m = m * m
  put m
  m = m + 15
  put m
  ```

### 7. Computational Thinking:

- In the information age, computational thinking, or creating step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, is crucial.
- An algorithm is a sequence of instructions designed to solve a problem.
  
#### Turtle Graphics:

- A method to learn about algorithms.
- Use simple commands like "Turn left", "Walk forward", "Pen down" to guide a turtle and draw shapes.
- Experimenting with these instructions can yield various shapes, like triangles or squares.

**Key Points to Remember**:
- The order of instructions in a program matters.
- Programming involves taking inputs, processing them, and producing outputs.
- Variables store data and their values can change.
- Computational thinking is an essential skill for the information age.
- Algorithms are sequences of instructions that solve specific problems.
