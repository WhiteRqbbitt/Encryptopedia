Using python we can pull this shell code into something usable
```python
#1/user/bin/env python3

with open("shellcode.txt", "r") as f:
	hex_string = f.read().replace("0x","").replace("byte[] rsrc = new byte[464] {","").replace("};","").replace(",","")

	hex_encode = hex_string.encode()

#print(hex_string)

#print(hex_encode)

with open ("out.bin", "wb") as out:
	out.write(hex_encode)
```
