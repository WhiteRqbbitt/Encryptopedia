# [[03 - Shell Code Analysis]]  
___

Shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It's often written in machine code and is typically used to directly control the operation of the processor. Due to this, shellcode analysis is a key aspect of malware analysis and incident response.

## Purpose of Shellcode

Shellcode is designed to be injected into a running program and executed. It often aims to create a shell (hence the name 'shellcode') which can be used by an attacker to control the system, although shellcode can also perform many other types of operations, such as downloading files, manipulating processes, or creating backdoors.

## Analysis Techniques

The process of shellcode analysis often involves several steps:

1. **Static Analysis**: This involves examining the shellcode without executing it. Tools such as disassemblers can convert the machine code into assembly code, making it easier to understand. It's important to have a basic understanding of assembly language for this.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**: This involves executing the shellcode in a controlled environment and observing its behavior. Tools such as debuggers can be used to step through the execution of the code, observing changes to memory and registers.

3. **Automated Analysis**: Tools like [[04 - SCDBG]] (Shellcode Debugger) can help emulate the functionality of shellcode, providing detailed output on its behavior without needing to execute it in a live environment.

## Tools for Shellcode Analysis

1. **Disassemblers**: IDA Pro, Ghidra, and Radare2 can be used to disassemble shellcode into assembly code.

2. **Debuggers**: Debugging tools like OllyDbg, x64dbg, and GDB can be used to observe the behavior of shellcode during execution.

3. **Emulators**: Tools like `scdbg` and `libemu` can emulate shellcode execution and provide detailed reports on its functionality.

4. **Hex Editors**: Hex editors like HxD or Hex Fiend allow you to examine the raw bytes of the shellcode.

## Key Considerations

- Be cautious: Shellcode can be dangerous. Always handle and analyze shellcode in a safe, isolated environment to avoid inadvertent execution.

- Understand Assembly: A basic understanding of assembly language is crucial to make sense of disassembled shellcode.

- Note Endianness: Be aware of endianness when examining shellcode. Different systems handle bytes in different orders, which can affect how the code should be read.

- NOP Sleds: Look for sequences of NOP (no operation) instructions, often used to "pad" the shellcode, making it easier to hit in a buffer overflow attack.

- Obfuscation: Shellcode might be obfuscated to avoid detection. Techniques include encryption, encoding, polymorphism, and packing.

As with any form of malware analysis, shellcode analysis requires a careful and methodical approach, along with an understanding of various tools and techniques. It can be a complex field, but is an invaluable skill in the fight against malware.





## Example

![[Pasted image 20230803210523.png]]

Using python we can pull this shell code into something usable
```python
#1/user/bin/env python3

with open("shellcode.txt", "r") as f:
	hex_string = f.read().replace("0x","").replace("byte[] rsrc = new byte[464] {","").replace("};","").replace(",","")

	hex_encode = hex_string.encode()

#print(hex_string)

#print(hex_encode)

with open ("out.bin", "wb") as out:
	out.write(hex_encode)
```
