## Usage

- To set permissions using octal values:
  ```chmod <permissions> <file/directory>```

  Example: ```chmod 755 myfile.txt```

- To set permissions for user (u), group (g), and others (o) separately:
  ```chmod u=<permissions>,g=<permissions>,o=<permissions> <file/directory>```

  Example: ```chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile.txt```

- To add (+) or remove (-) specific permissions:
  ```chmod <who><operator><permissions> <file/directory>```

  Example: ```chmod u+x myfile.txt``` (Add execute permission for user)

## Recursive Permissions

- To set permissions recursively for directories and their contents:
  ```chmod -R <permissions> <directory>```

  Example: ```chmod -R 755 mydir```
