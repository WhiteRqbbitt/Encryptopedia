**Post-Incident Activities: Lessons Learned, Incident Data, and Evidence Retention**

## **Lessons Learned:**

1. Incident Response (IR) process refinement occurs in a meeting reviewing the incident(s).
2. Discussion points: occurrence timeline, staff/management performance, procedure adequacy, need for information, recovery inhibitors, potential improvement strategies, and future preventive actions.
3. Post-incident activities for minor incidents are usually limited unless new, concerning attack methods are involved. More significant activities for large-scale incidents.
4. Post-mortem meetings essential for serious attacks, involving all relevant parties for information sharing.
5. Meeting reports valuable for training, updating IR policies/procedures, and creating a reference for similar future incidents.
6. Formal chronology documentation for legal purposes and damage assessment.

## **Using Collected Incident Data:**

1. Objective and subjective data for funding justification, detecting systemic security weaknesses, supporting risk assessments, and evaluating IR team performance.
2. Focus on actionable data representing business process threats.
3. Metrics can include: incident numbers, time per incident, labor spent, response times, objective and subjective assessments of each incident, and measures of success.
4. Data collection should be based on reporting requirements and data ROI.

## **Evidence Retention:**

1. Evidence retention policy determines how long incident evidence is held.
2. Considerations: prosecution requirements, data retention policies (GRS 24 specifies three years for incident handling records), and cost of long-term storage.
