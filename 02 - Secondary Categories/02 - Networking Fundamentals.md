# OSI/TCP Model

- ##### Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
# OSI Model Layers

- ### Layer 7: Application Layer
	- Role: Interface for end-users and applications
	- Example: HTTP, FTP.
	- Key Point: Handles specific communication functions for applications.

- ### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
	- Role: Transforms data to/from the application layer.
	- Example: XML, JSON.
	- Key Point: Manages encryption, character encoding, and data compression.

- ### Layer 5: Session Layer
	- Role: Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.
	- Key Point: Manages connections, but note that some functions, like those of TCP, cross over into the transport layer.

- ### Layer 4: Transport Layer
	- Role: Ensures data transfer is reliable and manages end-to-end connections.
	- Example: TCP, UDP.
	- Key Point: It's where headers for TCP or UDP are added.

- ### 3: Network Layer
	- Role: Responsible for determining the best path to route data across networks.
	- Example: IP (Internet Protocol).
	- Key Point: IP headers are added here.

- ### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
	- Role: Deals with communication between adjacent network nodes.
	- Key Point: Manages MAC addresses and encoding/decoding into bits. Ethernet frames or other protocols are used at this layer.

- ### Layer 1: Physical Layer
	- Role: Manages transmission/reception of raw binary data.
	- Key Point: Deals with the physical connection, converting data to electrical signals or vice versa.
