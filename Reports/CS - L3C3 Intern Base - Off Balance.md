# [[CS - L3C3 Intern Base - Off Balance]]  
___

## Briefing

>We're hot on the heels of catching this cyber gang but the closer we get, the more damage they try to inflict onto the Barcelona tourism industry!
>This time, they've hacked into a large international bank's mobile application. Customers of the bank are complaining they can't see their currentÂ **balance**Â and these criminal masterminds need to be held toÂ **account**. Intern, help customers retrieve their balances, so they can continue to spend their money during their well-earned holidays!
>Helping our international friends will really help develop ourÂ **network**.

> If we open our dev tools (I like to just right click and hit inspect) and move to the `Network` tab after clicking through this IPhone we find that `get-balances` is coming up `404` while the others are coming in `200`

> Now if we pull up the details of the `get-balances` we can see this in greater detail, most importantly the URL request.

> Lets see what a working request looks like...

> And if we visit this status `200` site we are greeted with an error...

> Easy enough, lets check the next tab to the `header`, `payload` and we find our token!

> Okay so we've done some digging...
> - We know the `get-balances` url is not working
> - We know the others are...
> - But we need a token to view the site while not in the app/IPhone
> - We have this token

> Lets swing by our terminal and use the tool `curl`
